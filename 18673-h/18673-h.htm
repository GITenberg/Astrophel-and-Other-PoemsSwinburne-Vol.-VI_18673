<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The dawn of night more fair than morning rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stars hurrying forth on stars, as snows on snows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haste when the wind and winter bid them speed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vague miles of moorland road behind us lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce traversed ere the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sank, and the sun forsook us at our need,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Belated. Where we thought to have rested, rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was none; for soft Maree's dim quivering breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound round with gracious inland girth of green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fearless of the wild wave-wandering West,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone shelterless for strangers; and unseen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The goal before us lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all our blithe and strange and strenuous day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For when the northering road faced westward&mdash;when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dark sharp sudden gorge dropped seaward&mdash;then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the stars, between the steeps, the track<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We followed, lighted not of moon or sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plunging whither none<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span><span class="i0">Might guess, while heaven and earth were hoar and black,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And through the twilight leftward of the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down the dark, with many a laugh and leap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light blithe hill-streams shone from scaur to steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In glittering pride of play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever while the night grew great and deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We felt but saw not what the hills would keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sacred awhile from sense of moon or star;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And full and far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath us, sweet and strange as heaven may be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The very sea: no mountain-moulded lake<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And only from the storms a casual sound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea, that harbours in her heart sublime<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not a whisper or lisp from the waters: the skies were not silenter. Peace<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not a sound, but a sense that possessed and pervaded with patient delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul and the body, clothed round with the comfort of limitless night.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span><span class="i0">Night infinite, living, adorable, loved of the land and the sea:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We saw not, we heard not, the face or the voice of the waters: we knew<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By the pulse of the darkness about us enkindled and quickened, that here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseen and unheard of us, surely the goal we had faith in was near.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The soft waves whisper and welter,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Subdued, and allured to subside,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By the mild night's magic: the lonely<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Sweet silence was soothed, not stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the noiseless noise of the gleaming<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All night long, in the world of sleep,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Throbbed the sense of the sea's life round:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Soft as darkness and keen as light.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">From the gorge we had travelled by starlight the sunrise, winged and aflame,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As it came and caressed and possessed them, till panting and laughing with light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From mountain to mountain the water was kindled and stung to delight.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the rampart of rock, stark naked, that thwarted and barred it, was clad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a stern grey splendour of sunrise: and scarce had I sprung to the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the dawn and the water were wedded, the hills and the sky set free.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chain of the night was broken: the waves that embraced me and smiled<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Could be for the birds whose triumph rejoiced that a day was born.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And a day was arisen indeed for us. Years and the changes of years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed round with their joys and their sorrows, and dead as their hopes and their fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie noteless and nameless, unlit by remembrance or record of days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worth wonder or memory, or cursing or blessing, or passion or praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between us who live and forget not, but yearn with delight in it yet,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the years that were kindlier and fairer, and kindled with pleasures as keen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have eclipsed not with lights or with shadows the light on the face of it seen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For softly and surely, as nearer the boat that we gazed from drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The face of the precipice opened and bade us as birds pass through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bark shot sheer to the sea through the strait of the sharp steep cleft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The portal that opens with imminent rampires to right and to left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sublime as the sky they darken and strange as a spell-struck dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the world unconfined of the mountains, the reign of the sea supreme,<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
